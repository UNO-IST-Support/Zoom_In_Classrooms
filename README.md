If you have having audio issues, please make sure echo canceling speaker is selected. You can do this by selecting the carrot arrow by the microphone on the zoom meeting and selecting that option. It should be near the top of the box.

Once you are done with the room, please make sure you shut it down. You can do this by clicking the shutdown button in the upper-left and confirming the shutdown. This will allow the equipment to have a break and let us use it longer.
