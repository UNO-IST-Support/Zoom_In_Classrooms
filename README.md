### How to use the Touch Panel 

The first screen is for the projectors and the doc cam.

To use the projectors, please drag and drop the device you want to project on the projector you would like to use. 
The right side box will display on the right, and the left side box will display on the left. Once you have dragged a source onto the projector, please give it some time to warm up and appear on the screens.

During your class, you may need to zoom on the instructor station. You will be able to do this with the rear camera. This camera will also give you 2 other options: screen and wide. Screen will show the board and wide will show a wideshot of the instructor and the board.
There are arrows on the touch panel if you need to move the camera up, down, left, or right.

The front camera is for showing the classroom if you need to show a student standing or have something else to show while not being in front of the board or instructor station.

If you have having audio issues, please make sure echo canceling speaker is selected. You can do this by selecting the carrot arrow by the microphone on the zoom meeting and selecting that option. It should be near the top of the box.
